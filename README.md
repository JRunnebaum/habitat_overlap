Evaluating species interaction through suitable habitat

Co-authors: Kisei Tanaka, Lisha Guan, Jie Cao, Loretta O'Brien, and Yong Chen

This framework extracts density estimates from a VAST single species model for use in a habitat suitability model developed over the same spatial grid. The single species VAST density estimates and HSI are developed for each species over the same grid to allow for comparison of areas of habitat overlap. This framework was used to evaluate bycatch hotspots based on habitat suitability alone, derived from fisheries-independent surveys in the absence of fisheries bycatch data.
